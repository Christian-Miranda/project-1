  <h1>Hello, I'm Christian!</h1>
  <p>I am a first year undergraduate majoring in Applied Cybersecurity and Information Technology.</p>
  <p>This is my second semester here at Illinois Tech (Written Spring 2026). I'm having a great time.</p>
  <p>I've met a lot of new people and new friends. Everyone's college experience is unique and now I can say that aswell!</p>
  <h2>My College expierence</h2>
  <p>Going into fall, I had no idea what would unfold in the coming months. I was just expecting classes and homework.</p>
  <p>Welcome week went well, it got boring after day 2, but I was getting used to the campus.</p>
  <p>Then, Taste of the Quad happened that saturday and things started to come into place.</p>
