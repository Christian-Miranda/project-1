  <h1>Hello, I'm Christian!</h1>
  <p>I am a first year undergraduate majoring in Applied Cybersecurity and Information Technology.</p>
  <p>This is my second semester here at Illinois Tech (Written Spring 2026). I'm having a great time.</p>
  <p>I've met a lot of new people and new friends. Everyone's college experience is unique and now I can say that aswell!</p>
  <h2>My College expierence</h2>
  <p>Going into fall, I had no idea what would unfold in the coming months. I was just expecting classes and homework.</p>
  <p>Welcome week went well, it got boring after day 2, but I was getting used to the campus.</p>
  <p>Then, Taste of the Quad happened that saturday and things started to come into place.</p>
  <h3>Joing the Alpha Epsilon Chapter of Phi Kappa Sigma</h3>
  <p>I joined a fraternity, a shocker even to me.</p>
  <p>I had little interest in greek life and just thought of fraternities the same way they are portrayed in media.</p>
  <p>For me, Skulls (Phi Kapaa Sigma) was a fraternity that was different from the rest on campus</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The house was clean and well maintained by the members</li>
    <li>The food was amazing and way better than the commons</li>
    <li>It was also a dry fraternity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All of this combined and the rest of the members being great people made me decide to rush Skulls</p>

  <p>Here I am in the middle of the second row for our Fall 2025 initiation.</p>
  <h3>Chicago Marathon Volunteering</h3>
  <p>One of the things we do at Skulls in participate in community service.</p>
  <p>Each fall and spring we volunteer for the Chicago Marathon and Shamrock Shuffle.</p>
  <p>I was able to volunteer at the 2025 Chicago Marathon to prepare water for all the particpants.</p>
  <p>It was amazing to see so many people while also being able to hand them water, which you need to develop a certain technique so the cup isn't dropped.</p>

  <p>It was a great time and I can't wait to volunteer for more of these events. Also that's me in the middle with my Illinois Tech red shirt.</p>
